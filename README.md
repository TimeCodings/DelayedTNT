**What's this?** <br>
A simple plugin to simplify TNT-Spawning in Minecraft. This plugin is also able to delay TNT-Spawning so they won't get spawned all at once. (Working at TikFinity)

**Installation:** <br>
**1.** Download the newest version from Releases <br>
**2.** Drag and Drop the newest version from the Downloads to the plugins folder of your Minecraft-Server <br>
**3.** Start/Restart your server <br>
**4.** You're ready to go!<br>

**How to use it?:** <br>
Simply use the command **/tnt Amount PlayerName** to spawn/delay (a) tnt(s)<br>
**Side-Note:** Amount and PlayerName aren't necessary

**How can I change the delay, the fuzing-time or the Permission?:** <br>
All of this options can be changed in the **config.yml** which can be found in the **DelayedTNT** folder (in the plugins folder of your Minecraft-Server) <br>
**Note:** The delay must be configurated in ticks! 20 Ticks = 1 Second

**Commands:** <br>
/tnt <Amount> - Spawns multiple TNT with the delay set in the config.yml <br>
/tnt <Amount> <Player> - Spawns multiple TNT for a specific player <br>
/tnt <Amount> <Delay> <Fuse> - Spawns multiple TNT with a custom delay and fuse <br>
/tnt <Amount> <Delay> <Fuse> <Player> - Spawns multiple TNT with a custom delay and fuse for a specific player <br>
